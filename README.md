# PSF (Parallel Snippet-Finder)

This repository is related to the PSF (Parallel Snippet-Finder) algorithm that accelerates snippet discovery in time series with a graphics processor. PSF is authored by Andrey Goglachev (goglachevai@susu.ru) and Mikhail Zymbler (mzym@susu.ru), South Ural State University, Chelyabinsk, Russia. The repository contains the PSF's source code (in C, CUDA) and accompanying datasets.

PSF is described in detail in our article Zymbler M., Goglachev A. Fast Summarization of Long Time Series with Graphics Processor // Mathematics. 2022. Vol. 10, No. 10. Article 1781. DOI: [10.3390/math10101781](https://doi.org/10.3390/math10101781)
